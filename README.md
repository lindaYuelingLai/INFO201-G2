# INFO201-G3

## The Data
We used a dataset of fatal shooting in the US for our project. This particular dataset 
comes from the Washington Post. Data for this set began to be taken in January 2015,
and it continues to be updated daily. The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings). 
We have grouped the data by race to see if we can find a correlation between police and 
racism, particularly towards people of color.  

## The Application
Our application, which can be found [here](https://liarose.shinyapps.io/info201-af3/), illustrates the data in several ways, 
ranging from bar plots to a pie chart and 
geographical map. The data for the bar plots can also be filtered in several ways to 
visualize how each race (or all races) may be affected by police shootings/behavior. Data can 
also be filtered by other factors, such as any arms the victim might have been carrying,
or whether they showed any signs of mental illness.  

The shiny application itself is split into four tabs: 

* Overview  
* Bar Plots  
* Other Visuals  
* Summary   

Our overall goal with this project and this particular topic is to bring awareness to
police brutality, and to help people understand that this is a major problem in America
that is easy to ignore or look past when you are not the one being shot at. Of course,
not all fatal police shooting are born out of racism, but it is nonetheless extremely
important to take note of how systemic racism can play a significant role in how 
someone is treated, and how people treat others, even when they do not always mean to, 
or do not realize they are doing so.
